            <h3>Bored Web Application</h3>
            <p>
                 Web app that I created to give me ideas of what to do when I am bored. The application communicates with the bored api. 
                 Users are able to get a completley random activity and they are able add conditions to the generated activity.

            <h3>Diner Blazor Web Applicatoin</h3>
            <p>
                 Project I am currently working on that simulates a diner. Great example of objects working together. The purpose of the 
                simulation is to answer different quesiotns like "How long will it take to serve 'X' number of customers?", and "How much
                time does a given employee have free durring a shift?" Multiple threads are at work. I manage the workflows for each 
                set of employees with a producer consumer queue.
